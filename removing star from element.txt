//at starting there will be no element in ans so when ever we find * then pop the previous one and we will not push * else we will push s[i].
//exmaple:-*jjjjj -->if starting element is * so that means there is no element in ans so we can pop it out and according to question we have to pop left element that means if * is not at first position so some elemetn must be in ans and it is obious that it will be left element .
